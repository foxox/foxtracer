foxtracer
=========

A physically-based monte-carlo raytracing engine


Under heavy development for the time-being!



Overview
========

Initial input will be perhaps Wavefront OBJ files and MTL file material specifications, maybe Collada DAE files later. Image (texture) files will have to be BMPs to start.

Output will be to the screen with an OpenGL view, and also to a BMP file.


Environment
==
Developed in VS 2010/2013 on Windows 7 x64 Pro
